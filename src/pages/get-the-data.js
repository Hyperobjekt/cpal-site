            The Community Resource Index was calculated primarily from publicly available data, either from state and federal agencies or local to the Dallas area. The CRI, and the Community Resource Explorer, is only one way that the data can support organizations working to improve our communities. We believe it is critical that we make the data we used to calculate the CRI available for use in additional capacities. You can download the data, R scripts, and ArcGIS tools CPAL created to calculate the CRI from the links below or by visiting our Github.
