- subtitle: Get the data
  intro: '<p>The Community Resource Index was calculated primarily from publicly
            available data, either from state and federal agencies or local to
            the Dallas area. The CRI, and the Community Resource Explorer, is
            only one way that the data can support organizations working to
            improve our communities. We believe it is critical that we make the
            data we used to calculate the CRI available for use in additional
            capacities. You can download the data, R scripts, and ArcGIS tools
            CPAL created to calculate the CRI from the links below or by
