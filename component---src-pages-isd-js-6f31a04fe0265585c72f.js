Dallas ISD has courageously recognized that “intentional decisions . . .have led to racial and economic segregation that produced major inequities that persist to this day” and is determined to right the wrongs of the past.","Beginning with $40M + in Bond funding, Dallas ISD plans to develop Student and Family Resource Centers in four feeder patterns - Lincoln, Spruce, Pinkston, and Roosevelt - that exist in once red - or yellow - lined neighborhoods. The goal of the Resource Centers is to significantly improve academic achievement for Dallas students through an intentional and concerted effort to impact the quality of life for students and their families. By addressing local challenges as they relate to health, education, economics, family, and community, students will come to school better prepared to learn and thrive."]},{type:"quote",text:"When the district had to shut down, a lot of kids went home with tablets but they have no wifi.
